## About Oxycore

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Oxycore framework. If you want to build an app using Oxycore, visit the main [Oxycore repository](https://github.com/oxycore/oxycore).

Oxycore is a web app framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Oxycore attempts to take the pain out of dev by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Routing Engine](https://todo.pro/)
- [Dependency Injection](https://todo.pro/)
- [Event handler](https://todo.pro/).

## License

The Oxycore framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
